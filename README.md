For the FMSB main screen center display part.

Req: 
- One-page PDF files to be displayed
- 'Auslaufdatum.csv' for pdf lifetime information

Known Issues:
    CSV must be named itself as a "data anchor"; 'Empty' CSV would otherwise write empty file. Kinda cringe.
    A blank "Auslaufdatum.csv" will break the program; needs to be deleted to resume.
